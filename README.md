# Cloud Run Jobs Demo

## Downloading Starred Repositories

This project is a demonstration of how to use Google Cloud Run Jobs to periodically download
and update a user's starred repositories from the GitHub API.
It includes a sample Cloud Run Job that uses the GitHub API to fetch the list of
repositories starred by a specified user and log them in order to route those logs to a sink such as BigQuery.

## Prerequisites

To run the demo, you will need:

* A Google Cloud account with access to the Google Cloud Run, Cloud Workflow, and Cloud Scheduler services.
* The Google Cloud SDK, which includes the gcloud command-line tool for managing Google Cloud resources.
* A GitHub personal access token with the public_repo scope, which will be used to authenticate the GitHub API requests.

## Running the demo

To run the demo, follow these steps:

Clone or download the [Cloud Run Jobs Demo](https://github.com/veggiemonk/cloud-run-jobs-demo) repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veggiemonk/cloud-run-jobs-demo
cd cloud-run-jobs-demo
```

### Locally

Set the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to your GitHub personal access token:

```bash
./build.sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token>
./bin/batch --username <your-github-username> --github-token $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### In Cloud Run

Use the gcloud tool to authenticate and set your default project and region:

```bash
gcloud auth login

gcloud config set project <your-project-id>

gcloud config set run/region <your-preferred-region>
```

> Read the `setup.sh` script to understand what is needed to run the demo.

```bash
cat setup.sh
```

Here is a sample of what will be deployed:
